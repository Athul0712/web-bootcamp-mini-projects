    <li><h3>Shadow slave</h3></li>
    <p>This was the novel that drew me into the world of online novels. 
        It's so captivating that I even skipped sleeping on multiple occassions just so I could keep being immersed in the story. 
        But the updation rate was a bit slow, hence I have put this on hold so I acn read it again when it's completed</p>

    <li><h3>Charm of Soul Pets</h3> </li>
    <p>Another really cool online novel that captures the beauty of reliance and companionship between a man and his contracted battle pets in a Fanstasy World. 
        Though it had such an abrupt and sad ending that I was depressed for days after reading it and it has many world-building elements that doesn't make sense, I still really enjoyed reading it.</p>

    <li><h3>Beast Taming Starting from Zero</h3></li>
    <p>Another really good online novel that captures the beauty of companionship and growth between a tamer and his beasts. 
        The story really explains each powerup and does not gloss over the details.
        The story is engaging and the world-building is impressive, making it a memorable read.</p>
